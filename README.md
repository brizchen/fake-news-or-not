# Fake News or Not?
 An interactive web game teaching users about how indistinguishable fake news is from real news during an age where AI can generate false headlines.
 
Some headlines are real, others are fake and generated by AI. It's up to the user to determine whether the displayed headline is fake or not, and at the end they are scored to see how they perform.

How easy is it to create misinformation in a world where humans are relying more on artificial intelligence? This tool aims to educate users about this topic. It also aims to convey that when training and creating machine-learning algorithms, it's becoming more difficult to distinguish real between fake, therefore making it more difficult to control the spread of misinformation in the digital news space.

# Code Resources
I used the external **API NewsAPI** (https://newsapi.org/) to generate real news headlines for the app. No open-source code was imported and/or changed.

The fake headlines were generated via ChatGPT, creating a dataset of ~500 AI-generated headlines. The ones that were most similar to the real-world headline dataset were used in the implementation of this app.
