        <h1>Fake News or Not?</h1>
        <p><i>Are machine-learning (ML) algorithms enough to mitigate the spread of disinformation?</i></p>
        <p>Let's see if you can distinguish real news headlines from fake ones, just like an ML model might be trained on the same data sets.</p>

        <p>How easy is it to create misinformation in a world where humans are relying more on artificial intelligence? This tool aims to educate users about this topic. It also aims to convey that when training and creating machine-learning algorithms, it's becoming more difficult to distinguish real between fake, therefore making it more difficult to control the spread of misinformation in the digital news space.</p>
        <p>AI-generated disinformation goes beyond text as well. Read more <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ai-generated-disinformation-poses-threat-of-misleading-voters-in-2024-election">here.</a></p>
